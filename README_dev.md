# steps that you need to do 

- create a project in firebase

- follow this link ``https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios``

- when you're doing ``flutterfire configure`` and select the project you created
that should update the file ``.firebaserc`` and the file called ``firebase_options``

leave the file ``firebase.json`` as it is

- currently I've setup the sign ``signInAnonymously`` you can change that as you like, the UI
refreshes accordingly to state
